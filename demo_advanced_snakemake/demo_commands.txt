Add option to run multiple threads per rule
--threads

Install the slurm plugin to be able to run the workflow on the slurm cluster
https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm.html

conda install bioconda::snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm

run the workflow with -e slurm or --executor slurm

Need to specify additional resources:
 - Memory
 - CPUS
 - Partition
 - Runtime


slurm specific commands:
sinfo
squeue
sacct
scontrol

Resources can be set for all rules or per rule. Best practise is to create a workflow profile.
Which is a directory containing another config file -> must be named config.yaml

create folder: slurm-profile
create config.yaml

Show that there are resources allocated for all rules. And a seplsarate part for the count_lines rule
Run the workflow using:
snakemake --jobs 2 -s demo.smk --workflow-profile slurm-profile/

You can use the profile to add all commandline arguments, such as the slurm, configfile, jobs, etc...
Run the workflow using:
snakemake --workflow-profile slurm-profile/ --dryrun
